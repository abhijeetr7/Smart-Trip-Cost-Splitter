# Smart-Trip-Cost-Splitter

This application is now ready for you to use!

How to use it:

Add Participants: Enter names in the "Participants" section and click "Add Participant".

Add Expenses:

Fill in the "Description" and "Amount".

Select who "Paid By" from the dropdown.

Check the boxes for everyone the expense was "Paid For".

Choose a "Category".

Click "Add Expense".

View Summary: The "Spending by Category" pie chart will update automatically, and the "Final Balance Summary" will show who owes whom.

Remove Items: You can remove participants or individual expenses using the "Remove" buttons next to them.

Clear All: Use the "Clear All Data" button to reset the entire application.

I've used Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design and Chart.js to render the interactive pie chart. The logic handles dynamic additions, removals, and accurate balance calculations.
